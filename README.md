Here it is! in all its elegance and glory, the historical past monarch of computing technology, The magnificient antiquity that graced the computer world with new innovation and incredible specs. I can't even compare my disqusting atrocius modern computers' terrible function and specs to its grand stature. If I havent already convinced you to purchase this absolute treasure of a computer, hopefully its extremely reasonable and cheap price of 1,670 dollars (*to adjust for inflation*) will prove you otherwise. If you aren't already violently shaking in your seat and looking to purchase this computer on Amazon I will unfortunately have to inform you that the computer is discontinued due to the corruption of modern computer companies attempting to make worse computers for more profit. Still not convinced, ~~these specs be mad fact spitting yo~~ Commodore Amiga we stan.

## So, to start off, my computer is a dell with these abismal specs

#### DELL INSPIRON 14 500                                       
| Type of specity spec spec| INFO                            | 
| -------------------------|:-------------------------------:| 
| Processor Type           | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU  | 
| Processor Speed          | 1.80GHz   1.99 GHz              |   
| Graphics card(GPU) type  | Intel(R) UHD Graphics Family    |    
| GPU brand                | (Manufacturer) Intel Corporation|
| GPU speed                | 300 MGhz to 1.10-1.15 GHz       | 
| GPU memory               | 128 MB                          |
| Storage (HDD or SDD)     | SATA                            |
| Storage Space            | 1 TB                            |
| Memory (RAM)             | 16 GB                           |

So the Dell Inspiron 14 500 has pretty usual specs with the exception of the Graphics card being integrated with the processor instead of it being its own unit, due to the computer not being designed for any gaming purposes. It is also, as I said before, a disgusting atrocity, unlike the Commodore Amiga 500.

### The Commodore Amiga 500 (A500) was released in April 1987 in the Netherlands 🇳🇱, after which in 1992 it was discontinued. BUT WHYYYYY?! Its specs were amazing! take a look!


> + The Commodore Amiga had a Motor lla 68000 CPU with an insane processing speed of 7.16 MHz (NTSC) or 7.09 MHz (PAL) this is about 250 time less than my Dell laptop's 2Ghz. Proccessing speed is overrated anyway!
>
> + The system displays video in analog RGB 50 Hz PAL or 60 Hz NTSC 
>
> + One 3.5" double-density floppy disk drive is built in. The user can also install up to three external floppy drives, either 3+1⁄2- or 5+1⁄4-inch, via the disk drive port. These drives can be double sided floppy discs containing 901 or 120 bytes
>
> + The computer has a built-in keyboard (like the DELL)
>
> + It's a home computer (non-transportable)(unlike the DELL) eww who wants a mobile PC?
>
> + It has 512 KB of Ram (memory) and can be increased to up to 10 MB with maximum upgrades! not too shabby for the time but still 1000 times less than my Dell laptops 8 Gigabytes.

Please keep in mind that no more information about the PC was available due to the age of the PC and the differences in the systems of computers.
